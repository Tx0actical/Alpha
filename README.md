## The aim of this project is to develop an "Anti-Virus Heuristic Engine"

Traditional protection methodologies involved the use of signature based detection. This was suitable when threats were not diverse and changed little over time. But this has changed. As code complexity has increased, traditional approaches to contain the cybersecurity risks associated with them have also proved to be ineffective, necessitating advancement in the protection methodologies. This is where Machine Learning comes inâ€¦

Heuristic Analysis uses machine learning to analyse file behaviour through attributes such as file extension, code samples, disassembly lookup etc. The main purpose is to adapt to new techniques employed by malware authors to bypass security solutions as they emerge because the rate of new malware discovery is much higher than what signature based detection can deal with.

Requirements for this project:

  - Windows kernel and application programming
  - Windows driver programming
  - Malware analysis
  - Reverse engineering and assembly language
  - Machine learning
  - C/C++ and Python

*This project will be knowledge intensive and time-consuming. So a detailed plan is required to be put in place.*

This project will proceed in three stages:

  1. Stage I: This will cover *core concepts*. Initially, project will support Windows, after that Linux can also be included.
    
    -> Windows Kernel, Driver Development    
    -> C/C++, Python                      

  2. Stage II: This will build up on the core concepts from previous stage.     

    -> Reverse Engineering                                    
    -> Assembly Language                         
    -> Malware Analysis                                           

  3. Stage III: This will incorporate heuristics.              

    -> Machine Learning            

> These stages can be further refined
